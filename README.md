# :racing_car: Weekly Formula 1 Comparisons 

Here you will find my weekly F1 podium drivers fastest lap comparisons. I will develop this README as time goes on, as well as grow the visuals as more insights become available. 

For the most part this is built on [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) which in turn uses Pandas. Visuals are built using Matplotlib.
